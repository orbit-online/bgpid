## Usage

### Functions

#### bg_add(pid)

Add the given PID to `$BG_PIDS`, then run `bg_block`.

Useful when running subshells that you don't want to wrap in a function, e.g.:

```
bg_block
(
  out=$(do thing)
  process "$out"
) & bg_add $!
bg_drain
```

Note that `bg_block` must be run before `bg_add` in order to not launch more
processes than `$BG_MAXPARALLEL` allows. If you are fine with
`$BG_MAXPARALLEL + 1` you can omit it.

#### bg_run(...cmd)

Run `bg_block`, then start `...cmd` in the background and add its PID to
`$BG_PIDS`.  
Does not start `...cmd` if `bg_block` fails.

#### bg_block()

Runs `bg_drain $BG_MAXPARALLEL-1` (unless `$BG_MAXPARALLEL=0`, then it just
returns 0).  
If `bg_drain` returns a non-zero exit code, `kill -$BG_SIGNAL` is called for all
remaining processes (if set), and then `bg_drain 0` is called.
Returns `0` or the return code of `bg_drain 0` on failure.

#### bg_drain([LVL=0])

Wait until there are no more than `LVL` running processes.  
Return `0` if all processes that completed while draining returned `0`
otherwise return the exit code of the last failed process.

#### bg_waitany()

Wait for exactly one process in `$BG_PIDS` to exit and returns its exit code.  
Returns `0` when no processes are running.

#### bg_init()

Initializes `$BG_PIDS` and `$BG_PIDS_OWNER`. This function is useful if you
intend to read or modify `$BG_PIDS`.

### Global variables

#### $BG_PIDS

Array containing the background PIDs bgpid is aware of. You may manually add
PIDs to it (`BG_PIDS+=($!)`) if the API does not satisfy a use-case, this does
not interfere with the inner workings of bgpid.  
However, to make sure you are not working with the array that was inherited from
a parent process run `bg_init()` first.

#### $BG_SIGNAL

The signal to send to processes when `bg_block` fails. Set this when you run
processes that do not quit on their own or do not want to wait for the remaining
processes to complete normally before failing in the parent process.

Default: `<UNSET>`

#### $BG_MAXPARALLEL

The maximum number of processes to run in parallel.  
Set to `0` to disable the limit.

Default: `4`

#### $BG_POLLRATE

The rate in seconds at which `bg_waitany()` should check whether one of the
background processes has exited.

Default: `0.05`

_Note: This is needed because calling `wait -n id...` returns the status of all
stopped processes, meaning failing exit codes may be hidden. If you know of a
way to block the process until a PID changes status and then get the exit code
of only that process, please open an issue, I'm all ears._

#### $BG_PIDS_OWNER

`$BG_PIDS` is a global variable (and therefore visible in subprocesses).
In order to maintain separation between parent and child processes,
this variable contains the owning process PID of `$BG_PIDS`.
